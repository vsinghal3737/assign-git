1. What is a gitignore file and what should it include for a Java project?
Answer: gitignore is usually used to set the files and files with common extension that git should ignore while pushing the code. These files are usually not useful to other members in the project and mid add unnecessary complexity while checking the commits.

These files should be included in gitignore in Java Project:
# Compiled class file
*.class

# Log file
*.log

# BlueJ files
*.ctxt

# Mobile Tools for Java (J2ME)
.mtj.tmp/

# Package Files
*.jar, *.war, *.nar, *.ear, *.zip, *.tar.gz, *.rar


2. What does fast-forward in Git mean?
Answer: If there is no change in the master branch, then any member in the project can merge his/her branch to master without any worries (well, if his/her branch's code is working), this is called fast-forward.


3. Why should you have different branches?
Answer: Branching is a critical feature for any SCC system. Let's assume that there are multiple functions that should be done parallelly or there are multiple people working on a single project then creating different branches for different functionality/member is the best way to go. By doing this we can do branch testing (testing if the new code is working) before merging with the main code (master branch), It can prevent messing up the whole project.


4. In a project how many remote Git repositories do you usually have?
Answer: In a project, we usually have one repository (there can be multiple branches).
But if there is a server (or website) which is connected to multiple git projects, then we can say that this server is actually built by multiple gits repositories.
